```php
$file = fopen('somefile.txt', 'r');
if ($file) {
    // Process the file
    fclose($file);
} else {
    // Handle the error appropriately.  For example:
    error_log('Could not open file: somefile.txt');
}
```
This improved version explicitly checks if `fopen` succeeded. Only if successful it proceeds with file processing and closure, avoiding the warning. It also adds error handling using `error_log`, which records the error in the system's log files.  You could replace this with other error handling techniques such as throwing an exception or displaying an error message to the user.
